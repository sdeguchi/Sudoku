# Sudoku
Solves a Sudoku puzzle

Takes two arguments for how many puzzles will be created every generation to find a solution, 
and how many generations the prgram will run without finding a solution. Input to cin sample files test.txt 
or test2.txt or 81 consecutive integers that form a Sudoku puzzle reading in the puzzle from left to 
right, row by row.
Outputs a fitness number 0 being solved and larger numbers being farther from a solution. Displays the solution 
or closest puzzle to a solution, and the number of generations run.
